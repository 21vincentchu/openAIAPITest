Question	Answer	Latency (s)
what fumehood are we using in the cleanroom?	The fume hood used in the cleanroom is the Supreme Air Series Fume Hood, Model HOM-1107, manufactured by Kewaunee Scientific Corporation. It is designed to contain harmful contaminants and vent them out of the work area.	2.150
What materials can be etched with RIE?	RIE can etch a variety of materials including dielectrics, silicon-based materials, II-V materials, and sputtered metals such as Si, SiO₂, Si₃N₄, GaAs, and polymers, depending on the gas chemistry and plasma conditions used.	2.013
What etch gases should I use for specific materials?	For etching silicon, use SF₆ or CF₄; for silicon dioxide, use CHF₃ or a CF₄/O₂ mix; for silicon nitride, use CHF₃/O₂; for metals like aluminum, use Cl₂ or BCl₃; and for removing photoresist, use O₂ plasma.	2.696
what are the key parameters in a standard RIE process?	The key parameters in a standard RIE process include RF power, chamber pressure, gas type and its flow rates, and etch time. These factors significantly influence the etching performance and results.	1.399
How do I Determine etch rate?	To determine the etch rate, measure the thickness of the material before and after etching using profilometry, ellipsometry, or SEM, and then calculate the etch rate using the formula: Etch Rate = (Initial Thickness - Final Thickness) / Time.	2.188
What are the safety precautions for oeprating an RIE system?	Safety precautions for operating an RIE system include using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), confirming gas line integrity and exhaust function, understanding the properties and hazards of process gases and chemicals, and adhering to established procedures without unauthorized modifications.	2.553
how to etch small area on water using RIE system?	To etch a small area on a wafer using an RIE system, apply a patterned mask to protect the unetched regions and then use the RIE process to selectively etch the exposed areas with the appropriate etch gases. Ensure precise alignment and control of etch parameters for accurate results.	1.916
How often should i clearn or maintain the chmaber?	The chamber of the RIE should be cleaned and maintained weekly or following heavy polymer-forming processes. Use dummy wafers or O2 plasma for cleaning, and regularly inspect electrodes and gaskets.	2.311
what causes non-uniform etching across the wafer?	Non-uniform etching across the wafer can be caused by poor gas distribution, inconsistent electrode contact, and chamber loading effects, which disrupt the uniformity of the plasma and etching process. Additionally, variations in substrate positioning and thickness can also contribute to etching inconsistencies.	2.147
