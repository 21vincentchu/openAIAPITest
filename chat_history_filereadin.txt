Question: What materials can be etched with RIE?
Answer: RIE can etch dielectrics and silicon-based films (Si, SiO2, Si3N4), III–V semiconductors (e.g., GaAs), some sputtered metals (with appropriate Cl‑ or BCl3 chemistries) and polymers/photoresist (O2 plasma); exact compatibility depends on gas chemistry and plasma conditions . The Oxford Plasmalab 80+ recipe set confirms available etch targets: LTO, thermal oxide, silicon nitride, polysilicon and silicon (consult staff before new/hazardous materials) .

Question: what are the key parameters in a standard RIE process?
Answer: Key RIE parameters: RF power (forward/bias), chamber pressure/base pressure, process gas chemistry and flow rates, and etch time (which together set etch rate and selectivity)  . Also monitor substrate/chamber temperatures (ATP/ACT), gas flow/forward power during the run, and vacuum/turbo status for uniformity and safety  .

Question: How do I Determine etch rate?
Answer: Measure film thickness before and after etch with profilometry, ellipsometry, or SEM, then compute etch rate = (Initial thickness − Final thickness) / Etch time.

Question: What are the safety precautions for oeprating an RIE system?
Answer: Wear full PPE (gloves, safety goggles/face shield, lab coat), verify gas-line integrity, exhaust and purge flows, confirm interlocks/EMO and cooling/water flow are functional, and be trained and authorized before operation  .  
Keep chamber panels closed, ensure pumps/turbo and purge are running before enabling RF, monitor gas flows, forward power, ATP/ACT temps during the run, know emergency shutdown/venting procedures, and never operate with covers removed or unattended; contact staff for any faults  .

Question: how to etch small area on water using RIE system?
Answer: Pattern the small area with an etch mask (photoresist, hard mask or tape) leaving only the target exposed, load the wafer into the RIE, select/verify a suitable recipe (gas, power, pressure, time) and run the etch; masking is the prescribed method for etching a specific small area . Follow the standard load/evacuate/run/vent sequence and confirm recipe parameters and plasma visually during the run per the Oxford RIE operating procedure .

Question: How often should i clearn or maintain the chmaber?
Answer: Clean the RIE chamber weekly and additionally after any heavy polymer‑forming processes; use dummy wafers or an O2 plasma and inspect electrodes and gaskets during maintenance.

Question: what causes non-uniform etching across the wafer?
Answer: Non‑uniform etching is caused by poor gas distribution, inconsistent electrode contact or RF power distribution, and chamber loading effects (pattern‑ or feature‑density dependent) .
