Question	Answer	Latency (s)
what fumehood are we using in the cleanroom?	The fume hood used in the cleanroom is the Supreme Air Series Fume Hood, Model HOM-1107, manufactured by Kewaunee Scientific Corporation. It is designed for the containment of harmful contaminants and proper ventilation.	2.439
What materials can be etched with RIE?	RIE can etch a variety of materials including dielectrics, silicon-based materials, II-V materials, and sputtered metals such as Si, SiO₂, Si₃N₄, GaAs, and polymers, depending on the gas chemistry and plasma conditions used.	1.693
What etch gases should I use for specific materials?	For silicon, use SF₆ or CF₄; for silicon dioxide, use CHF₃ or CF₄/O₂; for silicon nitride, use CHF₃/O₂; for metals like aluminum, use Cl₂/BCl₃; and for photoresist, use O₂ plasma.	2.251
what are the key parameters in a standard RIE process?	The key parameters in a standard RIE process include RF power, chamber pressure, gas type and its flow rates, and etch time. These factors significantly influence the etching efficiency and quality of the process.	2.049
How do I Determine etch rate?	To determine the etch rate, measure the thickness of the material before and after etching using techniques like profilometry, ellipsometry, or SEM, and calculate it using the formula: Etch Rate = (Initial Thickness - Final Thickness) / Time.	1.870
What are the safety precautions for oeprating an RIE system?	Safety precautions for operating an RIE system include using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), confirming gas line integrity and exhaust function, understanding the properties and hazards of process gases and chemicals, and adhering to established procedures without unauthorized modifications.	2.123
how to etch small area on water using RIE system?	To etch a small area on a wafer using an RIE system, apply a patterned mask to protect the areas you want to keep intact, then use the RIE process with appropriate gases to etch the exposed regions. Ensure precise alignment and control of etch parameters for accurate results.	2.048
How often should i clearn or maintain the chmaber?	The chamber of the RIE should be cleaned and maintained weekly or following heavy polymer-forming processes, using dummy wafers for cleaning steps. Regular inspection of electrodes and gaskets is also recommended.	1.731
what causes non-uniform etching across the wafer?	Non-uniform etching across the wafer can be caused by poor gas distribution, inconsistent electrode contact, and chamber loading effects, which can lead to variations in etch rates across different areas of the substrate. Maintaining stable chamber pressure and optimizing process parameters are crucial for achieving uniform etching.	2.059
